# Agventure

###Our Mission
We believe that the average person possesses the tools to combat hunger worldwide, if only he has a passport, a smartphone, and a desire for adventure! Designed by a group of students from Louisiana State University, Agventure connects small farmers worldwide with millions of travelers seeking unique, memorable, educational experiences through agritourism. Through our platform, Agventure, travelers are able to put money directly into the pockets of struggling farmers, allowing them to better provide for their families, invest in better agricultural inputs, and showcase their ways of life. Meanwhile, visitors learn just what goes into their food, fibers, and materials, in a fun, interactive way! Team Agventure believes that the power to defeat hunger worldwide lies in empowering people to make real, measurable change. With Agventure, why not add “changing the world” to your vacation itinerary?
